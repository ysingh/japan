 The most famous is the Miyako Odori (April 1-24) held by Gion Kobu, the most famous and prestigious of them. There's also the Kyo Odori (April 1-16) held by Miyagawacho, a kagai just next to Gion.

There's also Gion Corner, which has scheduled public maiko dances most days, I think.

EDIT: I know there are ways to book dinners with geiko/maiko attending, usually as some sort of tourist thing. Gion Hatanaka is pretty popular and is relatively cheap since you are part of a large group with the cost of the geiko and maiko split between everyone attending. I know there are other smaller tourist packages out there, as well, but those are likely more expensive.

Kanazawa also has its own, much smaller kagai, and I think they're pretty open to tourists. You could probably look them up on Google and see if any opportunities pop up. I don't know how expensive they are, though.
geisha experience we are doing in a few weeks in Kanazawa that was relatively inexpensive, it should come up if you search it. We also got tickets for the Miyako Odori coming in April.

On our last trip we did the japanican.com's Kyoto Maiko Evening Cuisine experience and that was cool- not too pricey and we got to eat a traditional kaiseki meal and watch geiko and maiko dance to shamisen music.
